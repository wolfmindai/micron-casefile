## 📦 Repository Layout

This repository includes **three private submodules** for evidentiary control and separation of disclosure classes:

| Submodule Path      | Description                                      | Visibility |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------|
| `restricted/`       | Sealed legal and strategic files                 | 🔒 Private |
| `emails-private/`   | Authenticated email communications archive       | 🔒 Private |
| `addenda-private/`  | Supplementary documents and structured addenda   | 🔒 Private |

These submodules are locked and write-protected under private governance until their partial or full release is required.

---

## 🧾 Purpose

This repository is intended for **public integrity assurance**. While not containing raw evidence directly, it cryptographically anchors the structure and timing of its linked submodules and commits.

It may be referenced in legal filings, regulatory disclosures, and compliance frameworks as a structurally attested digital record.
